# Crazy Arms Radio Backend &mdash; :zany_face: :mechanical_arm: :radio: :woman_technologist:

Crazy Arms Radio Backend is a flexible and fully featured Internet radio back-end

It's specifically written after its author built a few _fully decentralized_
online radio stations with varying types of scheduling and finding no existing
product fit some common needs out of the box.

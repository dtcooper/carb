# Crazy Arms Radio Backend

Crazy Arms Radio Backend is a flexible and fully featured Internet radio back-end
written from the ground up.

It's specifically written after its author built several _fully decentralized_
online radio stations with varied types of scheduling and finding no existing
product fit some common needs out of the box.

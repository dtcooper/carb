!!! warning "Zoom Time Limits"
    If you're _not_ using a paid Zoom account, or {{ config.STATION_NAME }}'s
    administrator has not set up a paid account, there are room time limits for group
    meetings held in Zoom rooms. (40 minutes at the time of this writing.) Your show will
    be capped at that length.

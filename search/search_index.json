This documentation is incomplete, is missing sections, and may include incorrect information until the first release. Crazy Arms Radio Backend is a flexible and fully featured Internet radio back-end written from the ground up. It's specifically written after its author built a few fully decentralized online radio stations with varying types of scheduling and finding no existing product fit some common needs out of the box. If you're an technical user or a systems administrator wanting to install Crazy Arms, head over to the installation instructions . Audio Infrastructure Overview \u00b6 Sources, Harbor, and Upstreams Explained \u00b6 The main audio component of Crazy Arms is called the Harbor. This is a customizable script, implemented in Liquidsoap that takes care of choosing what to broadcast and when. Think of the Harbor as a robot taking several sources and deciding which one is best to broadcast from based on some simple rules. The harbor has several input sources . These are things like pre-recorded broadcasts, live DJs, or the AutoDJ. Each are each assigned a priority, and the source with the highest priority that is active will be what the harbor chooses to play. A Note About Inactive Sources When a source goes from inactive to active, the harbor will smootly fade to it. For the \"Live Sources\" listed below (Live DJ and Live Zoom Room), we provide silence detection. This means if a DJ is connected and broadcasting silence, that source will be considered inactive.** In this case, the first active source with less priority will be broadcast. The theory behind this feature is part of the Idiot-Tolerant\u2122 DJing philosophy of Crazy Arms. flowchart LR subgraph sources [\"Priority-Based Sources\"] prerecord(\"1.

This means it chooses the source (audio input) that is streaming, properly operating, or online with the highest priority. For example, a live DJ takes priority over the AutoDJ. See more info on this concept below . Live scheduling via Google Calendar Scheduling of live DJs using Google Calendar. An invite to a calendar event means a DJ is authorized to play. Simple as that. Rather than re-invent the wheel, Google Calendar was chosen because of its wide adoption and east of use \u2014 and implementation of recurring events.. Your web front-end can integrate with that, rather than a complex, custom API. Scheduled playout of long-format audio files, ie prerecorded shows A major use case is taking long-format audio files (ie two hours) and scheduling them to play at specific times, superseding the AutoDJ. Broadcasting for non-technical users with Zoom This is implemented with Zoom for Linux using a Docker container. A \"runner\" bash script does its best to connect to a user's Zoom room and listen in. It's inherently a bit brittle, but can be troubleshooted somewhat easily in a web browser running noVNC by an admin. Idiot-Tolerant\u2122 DJing If a live DJ or Zoom room is broadcasting silence, Crazy Arms picks another source to stream from. Completely Docker -ized Easy development and easy deployment using docker-compose . Useful and informative station administration and status tools. Leveraging Django 's admin interface much of Crazy Arms can be managed by administrators (or users with the necessary permissions). A status page is also provided that uses server-sent events in which the Harbor service script communicates directly with your web browser in real-time. Uploading audio from varied sources Uploading of audio files from sources like SoundCloud , Mixcloud , or YouTube are supported. Just enter a URL and the Crazy Arms downloads and processes your audio file. This utilizes the wonderful youtube-dlc tool and supports literally thousands of sites ! An AutoDJ that plays blocks of advertisements and station IDs (stop sets) This feature can optionally be enabled in the \"Server Settings > Configuration\" section. Fine-grained user permission structure. If a user is not an administrator, there are several permission groups to allow them some administrative privileges. Accessible Logs Less technical users can see server logs without ssh or command-line knowledge to help troubleshoot. Maybe a DJ got their password wrong or tried to broadcast at the wrong time? Streaming Customization At your own risk, you can modify Liquidsoap Harbor scripts. This gives pretty high flexibility for various use cases. RTMP Support (Experimental) There's experimental support for RTMP, so anyone who's familiar with tools like Open Source Broadcaster (OBS) can stream to the harbor. Of course, video is discarded. Non-Features \u00b6 The following are non-features of Crazy Arms. Front-end Not Included Crazy Arms is designed to be a backend for your radio stream only. A user interface that includes calendars, a fancy stream player, and metadata isn't included. Admin Site Look and Feel The admin site for Crazy Arms has a fairly inflexible look and feel. It's not necessarily a beautiful, easy to use interface but instead meant for somewhat technical users. This is by design and was chosen for ease of programming. The technical reason for why is that we chose to build it on top of Django's admin site module.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#crazy-arms-radio-backend","text":"Crazy Arms is under active development Crazy Arms is currently under active development, however you can preview things right now.

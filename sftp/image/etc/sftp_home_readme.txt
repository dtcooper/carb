# Crazy Arms SFTP/SCP Uploads

You can upload audio assets via SFTP or SCP to be imported into Crazy Arms into
the following directories,

Audio Assets:
 - /audio-assets/
 - / (the root directory)

Rotator Assets:
 - /rotator-assets/

Scheduled Broadcast Assets:
 - /scheduled-broadcast-assets/

Notes:
 * After processing, assets will be imported and deleted.

 * If you don't permission to edit a type of asset above (or the feature is
   disabled), then the above directory won't show up.
   -  If you don't have AutoDJ programming permission, you won't have permission
      to upload files into the the root directory.

 * If you've enabled the "put uploads into playlists by folder" feature in your
   user profile, any subfolder you put an audio asset in will be the name of the
   playlist that it's put in. If one doesn't exist with that name, it'll be
   created for you.
